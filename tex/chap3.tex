\chapter{Conversion Service}

\section{Methodology}

The objective of the Conversion Service is to convert a given set of input WHIs into dzi files. Since a dzi is layered into a pyramid scheme, it is necessary to calculate the needed number of levels, as well as the dimensions of each level (see fig. 3.1 for an example).

Therefore, the Conversion Service must be able to open an WHI $img_{input}$ of any of the in 2.2.1 defined formats. Based on the size of $img_{input}$ the number of necessary levels $lvl$ must be calculated. Once $lvl$ has been determined, $img_{input}$ must be resized into an appropriate scale for each $lvl_i$ in $lvl$. The resized image will be called $img_i$, with $i$ representing the corresponding level. In the next step, every $img_i$ will be tessellated into $x*y$ tiles. Each tile will be referrenced via $t^i_{r,c}$, with $r$ being the row and $c$ being the column of the tile in $whi_i$. To complete the conversion, the Conversion Service must create a describing xml file for each converted image $img_{dzi}$.
